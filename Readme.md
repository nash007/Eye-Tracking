##eyeLike
An OpenCV based webcam gaze tracker based on a simple image gradient-based eye center algorithm by Fabian Timm.

This is still a work in progress and does not track gaze yet.

The credit for the eye-tracking part goes to 'trishume' and his work can be found at https://github.com/trishume/eyeLike

##Status
The eye center tracking works well but I don't have a reference point like eye corner yet so it can't actually track
where the user is looking.

If anyone with more experience than me has ideas on how to effectively track a reference point or head pose
so that the gaze point on the screen can be calculated contact me.

##Building

CMake is required to build eyeLike.

###OSX or Linux with Make
```bash
# do things in the build directory so that we don't clog up the main directory
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
./bin/eyeLike # the executable file
```

###On OSX with XCode
```bash
mkdir build
./cmakeBuild.sh
```
then open the XCode project in the build folder and run from there.

###On Windows
There is some way to use CMake on Windows but I am not familiar with it.
